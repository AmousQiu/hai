Finish the fade in and out mechanic

Make the win condition more rewarding.
- Explosion of characters
- Fireworks like.
- Potential to have some fun with an animation
-- Could animate some of the characters.

If the player gets 3 matches before the timer runs out, make it instant win.
There is currently no incentive to keep playing. Adding more incentive would
incrase the number of screens (work work).

Create new camera for 3d objects at the bottom of the screen
- They should be closer towards the bottom
- Should work for portrait and landscape and square

Reposition the "Match" text so that it doesn't overlap any of the other
elements.

Find a way to convey to the player that they need to match three things before
the timer runs out.

Consider replacing the number at the top of the screen with a health bar that
is going down based off of time.

Tidy up the art
- Create some consitency between characters
- Make sure they all sit at (0, 0, 0) 
- Are all facing the same way
- Scaled appropriately relative to each other
- Need a special scene to help with the creation of these guys?

Redo any non original sounds.
