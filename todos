Revisit intro sound: hai

Revisit transition from start to game
- Fade to black
- Because without sound, it seems like nothing happens for a bit.

Consider replacing the number at the top of the screen with a health bar that
is going down based off of time.

Find a way to convey to the player that they need to match three things before
the timer runs out.

If the player gets 3 matches before the timer runs out, make it instant win.
There is currently no incentive to keep playing. Adding more incentive would
incrase the number of screens (work work).

Tidy up the art
- Create some consitency between characters
- Make sure they all sit at (0, 0, 0) 
- Are all facing the same way
- Scaled appropriately relative to each other
- Need a special scene to help with the creation of these guys?

Create new camera for 3d objects at the bottom of the screen
- They should be closer towards the bottom
- Should work for portrait and landscape and square

Reposition the "Match" text so that it doesn't overlap any of the other
elements.

Redo any non original sounds.

Consider dropping the second level entierly for the purpose of putting onto the
store.
- And/Or iterate on this. Try a version with a timer.

Replace the start scene and End scene with a new scene "Ready?".

Expose tunables via json so that we can iterate on a few designs quicker.

Its a little too easy to click on the "Retry?" screen.
- Ideally some kind of transition or delay?
